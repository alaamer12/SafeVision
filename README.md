## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Custom Dataset Collection**: Download datasets containing NSFW and SFW images from various sources with fine-grained filters.
* 🧠 **Model Training**: Train powerful deep learning models to detect NSFW content.
* ⚙️ **Highly Configurable**: Control sources, categories, labeling rules, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters.
* 🔒 **Content Filtering**: Deploy the trained model to scan and block NSFW content in real-time.
* 🗃️ **Dataset Curator Mode**: Review, relabel, or remove samples before training.
